An Extension for Tabletop Tweaks: https://github.com/Vek17/WrathMods-TabletopTweaks

Version Required: 1.8.2a

Contents:

Extends Fighter Advanced Armor Training to all archetypes and prestiges that use it:
Oracle: Purifier
Magus: Armored Battlemage
Bloodrager: Steelblood
Hellknight
Hellknight Signifier

Enables cross-class scaling for Advanced Armor Training for the aforementioned classes

Purifer Improvmenets
Level 3 Revelation restored: Purifer has a forced pick in this slot on tabletop that is not implemented and largely unimplementable so the pick is restored
Early Cure spells restored: Purifier would otherwise be strictly worse than stock oracle until level 5 so they get CLW/CMW back. Life mystery Purifier is still largely SoL having to use up picks to fullful their base function tho.

Prodigious Two Weapon Fighting:
Use Strength rather than dex for TWF feat requirements, and remove oversized offhand weapon penalty
